Source Files for the 3D-Models
==============================

In this directory you will find OpenSCAD source files for the 3D-models.

You need to install the [BOSL2-library](https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2).

Some files contain the source for more than one model, e.g. the files for the
walls and fences.
